# Sort data by year in ascending order

# Define time series object
wagestime <- ts(avgwages$average, start = min(avgwages$year), end = max(avgwages$year), frequency = 1)

# Plot time series
plot(wagestime, main = "Average Wages Over Time", ylab = "Average", xlab = "Year")

# Check for stationarity with Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
adf.test(wagestime)

# Since the p-value is 0.7318, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, i.e., the series is not stationary. Using auto.arima function, we can find the best model parameters for our ARIMA timer series forecast.

# Fit ARIMA model
avgwages_model <- auto.arima(wagestime, ic = "aic", trace = TRUE)
summary(avgwages_model)

# Forecast the next 10 years
avgwages_forecast <- forecast(avgwages_model, h = 10)
plot(avgwages_forecast, main = "Average Wages Forecast", ylab = "Average", xlab = "Year")

# Check residuals for model diagnostics
checkresiduals(avgwages_model)

# Each lag in the ACF plot falls within the threshold, meaning there is no significant autocorrelation in the residuals at any lag. Hence, the model accurately forecasts the average wages in the next 10 years.
