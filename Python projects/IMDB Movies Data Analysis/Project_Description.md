# Project Description
In this project, we analyze data from IMDB consisting of the top 1000 movies and TV shows. Some of the questions we answer include the following:
* What is the average rating among movies in the list?
* Which actor took the lead roll most often?
* Which director directed the greatest number of moves in the list?
* How many movies from each decade are represented?
* Which genre was most popular?

To accomplish this, we use Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization.
