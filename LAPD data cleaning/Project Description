In this project, we seek to comprehensively clean the data set provided by the LAPD regarding crimes that have occured between 2020 up to the present year. Given the size of the data set, we limit our focus to only assault-related crimes.
The data set can be downloaded here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present
According to the website: 
"This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020. This data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data."
In our analysis, we observe that there are indeed many inaccuracies, particularly in the victim age and victim descent columns. We replace these inaccuracies with NaN values and then impute them using K-Nearest Neighbors imputation algorithm in scikit-learn.
The victim sex column contained X labels, signifying that the gender of the individual was unknown. We replaced all missing values with NaN, then used label encoding to replace each M and F label with 1 and 0, respectively. To ensure that the victim sex column is in one-hot encoding format, we created two separate gender columns while ensuring that all NaN values stay in place.
Finally, as an exercise, we replace every label in the Premis Desc (premise description) column with either 'public_property' or 'private_property' and apply one-hot encoding.
