# Data Science Projects
### A collection of data science projects demonstrating statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and data visualization using Python, R, TensorFlow, Tableau, and other tools.

## Projects List
   - ### Statistics
      - [Average wages time series forecast](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/R\%20projects/Average\%20wages\%20forecasting): In this project, I analyze trends in average wages over time and use ARIMA forecasting to predict the average wages for the next ten years.
         - **Tools Used:** R
      - [Ad Campaign A/B Testing](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Python\%20projects/AB_testing.ipynb): Performed A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of an ad campaign. Conducted a t-test to assess the statistical significance of differences in conversion rates between the control group (viewed only a public service announcement) and the experiment group (viewed the ad).
         - **Tools Used:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy 
   - ### Machine Learning
     -  [Sleep disorder prediction](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Python%20projects/Sleep%20Disorder%20Project): Using features such as age, gender, sleep quality, stress level, etc. we predict, using Logistic Regression, the likelihood that a person will suffer from a sleep disorder.
         - **Tools Used:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Seaborn
     -  [Book Recommendation System](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Book_Recommendation_System.ipynb): Scraped data from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup and requests. Built a recommendation system using TensorFlow, which leverages neural networks and embedding layers for text and categorical features like book titles, authors, genres, and other metadata to generate book recommendations.
         - **Tools Used:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
   - ### Data Analysis and Visualization
      - [IMDB data visualization](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/IMDB\%20Movies%20Data\%20Analysis/IMDB_data_analysis.ipynb): This project involves analyzing movie and TV show data from IMDB to uncover insights through data visualization techniques. We focus on a dataset of the top 1000 movies and TV shows, exploring various aspects such as average ratings, actor roles, and genre popularity.
         -  **Tools Used:** Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly
      - [Video Game Sales dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christian.morgan1649/viz/VideoGameSales_17288744403320/Dashboard1): In this dashboard, I explore historical trends in the video game industry. I wanted to allow users to see which games are most popular for each developer. Yearly sales and the number of games released each year can be observed for each developer.
         - **Tools Used:** Tableau
      - [LAPD data cleaning project](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20projects/LAPD%20data%20cleaning/LAPD_Crime_data_cleaning.ipynb): In this project, we perform data preprocessing to clean, impute, and transform the data so that it is ready for model training/testing. Here, we limit our attention to assault-related crimes. We are interested in predicting if such a crime was committed on public or private property using features such as age, gender, and race.
         - **Tools Used:** Pandas and NumPy
