# Data Science Portfolio
Data science projects showcasing comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning models, and statistical analyses using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and more.

1. [Sleep Disorder Project](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Sleep%20Disorder%20Project)
   - **Description:** Using features such as age, gender, sleep quality, stress level, etc. we predict, using Logistic Regression, the likelihood that a person will suffer from one of the following sleep disorders: insomnia or sleep apnea.
   - **Tools Used:** Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and plotly
2. [LAPD data cleaning project](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Sleep%20Disorder%20Project)
   - **Description:** In this project, we perform data preprocessing to clean, impute, and transform the data so that it is ready for model training/testing. Here, we limit our attention to assault-related crimes. We are interested in predicting if such a crime was committed on public or private property using features such as age, gender, and race.
   - **Tools Used:** Pandas and numpy
