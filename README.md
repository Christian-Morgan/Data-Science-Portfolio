# Data Science Projects
Data science projects showcasing comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning using Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and seaborn.

1. [Sleep Disorder Project](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Sleep%20Disorder%20Project)
   - **Description:** Using features such as age, gender, sleep quality, stress level, etc. we predict, using Logistic Regression, the likelihood that a person will suffer from a sleep disorder.
   - **Tools Used:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Seaborn
2. [LAPD data cleaning project](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/LAPD%20data%20cleaning)
   - **Description:** In this project, we perform data preprocessing to clean, impute, and transform the data so that it is ready for model training/testing. Here, we limit our attention to assault-related crimes. We are interested in predicting if such a crime was committed on public or private property using features such as age, gender, and race.
   - **Tools Used:** Pandas and NumPy
3. [IMDB data analysis](https://github.com/Christian-Morgan/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/IMDB%20Movies%20Data%20Analysis)
   - **Description:** This project involves analyzing movie and TV show data from IMDB to uncover insights through data visualization techniques. We focus on a dataset of the top 1000 movies and TV shows, exploring various aspects such as average ratings, actor roles, and genre popularity.
   - **Tools Used:** Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly
